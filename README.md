The Code of Ethics for the Assciation of Computer Science Ethics

## Forward

This document is born out of a university classroom teaching professional practices in computer science. It is envisioned as a replacement for any current (as of March 2017) Code of Ethics that could be applied to computer science. Current Codes of Ethics that have been proposed are neither cohesive nor comprehensive such as the CIPS Code of Ethics and the 10 commandments of computer ethics.

## Scope

This document is intended to address a severly lacking area for the discipline of computer science; it will be a cohesive and comprehensive document addressing ethics in the discipline of computer science.

## Contributing

This repository should be updated regularly so as to be kept up to date with the fast paced nature of computer science, as well as collaboratively revised. As a guideline; any pull request should be approved by the majority of the active members of the association.

## Organization

This repository is organized in the following structure:
- A directory for every chapter  
  - A README.md containing the table of contents  
  - A subdirectory for every sub-chapter with sub-chapters  

This is meant to keep this repository clean and intuitive.
